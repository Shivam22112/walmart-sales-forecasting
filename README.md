# dbda-big-data-walmart-stores-analysis-prediction

An end-to-end pipeline for Walmart sales forecasting using PySpark for ETL, Matplotlib/Seaborn for EDA, and a Random Forest model. The workflow is orchestrated with Apache Airflow, running ETL, EDA, and modeling sequentially. Visualizations are also created interactively on Databricks Community Edition.
